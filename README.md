# Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (tested with Node 24)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone <repo-url> firewall-intent-converter
cd firewall-intent-converter
npm install
node server.js
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

That's it — a single command runs both the Express API server and the Vite dev server (with hot module replacement) on port 3000.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build          # Vite compiles to dist/
NODE_ENV=production node server.js   # Serves static dist/ + API
```

## Usage

### 1a. Load a Configuration (Import Mode)

Select your source vendor from the dropdown (Junos SRX, PAN-OS, FortiGate, Cisco ASA/FTD, Check Point, SonicWall, or Huawei USG), then paste a configuration into the left panel or click one of the built-in sample configs. Then click **Parse**. The tool auto-detects the source format.

### 1b. Greenfield Mode (Build from Scratch)

Select **Greenfield (New Config)** from the vendor dropdown (preselected by default). Choose a starting template from the template picker:

- **Branch Office** — Small office with trust/untrust/management zones, outbound web/DNS/NTP policies, source NAT, screen profiles, and syslog
- **Data Center** — Multi-tier architecture with trust/untrust/dmz/server/management zones, strict inter-tier segmentation, dual screen profiles
- **Campus Edge** — Enterprise edge with trust/untrust/guest/voip/management zones, guest isolation, VoIP policies, user segmentation
- **Cloud Gateway** — Hybrid cloud with trust/untrust/cloud-east/cloud-west zones, cross-cloud routing, multi-region policies
- **Blank** — Empty configuration, start from scratch with the full LLM interview

Each template pre-fills zones, security policies, NAT rules, address objects, screen profiles, syslog, static routes, and **day-0 system config** (hostname, DNS servers, NTP servers, timezone, login banner, management services). The LLM interview skips use-case discovery for template-based configs and jumps straight to refinements.

For blank configs, the LLM walks you through a structured interview:

1. **Use Case Discovery** — Deployment type, connectivity details, and requirements
2. **Configuration Building** — Zones, interfaces, address objects, security policies, NAT rules, and system config are built progressively as you answer questions
3. **Best Practices** — Use-case-aware recommendations for screen profiles, logging, default-deny rules, and more

Toggle between **from LLM Interview** and **to SRX** tabs to see the configuration building in real-time. The chat preserves its state when switching tabs.

### 1c. SRX Health Check (Audit Mode)

Select **SRX Health Check** from the vendor dropdown to audit an existing SRX configuration for best practices, compliance, and security posture — without changing hardware. Paste your SRX config and click **Parse**. A simplified model selector opens where you select the source SRX model and subscription tier (target is automatically set to match). No interface mapping is needed.

Click **Run Health Check** to send all policies to the LLM for a comprehensive audit covering:

- **PCI DSS v4.0** — Explicit deny-all, documented business justification, rule review cadence
- **NIST SP 800-41r1** — Default-deny per zone pair, denied traffic logging, network segmentation
- **CIS Juniper OS Benchmark** — Management services, NTP auth, login banners
- **Logging completeness** — Session-close on permits, session-init on denies
- **Security profile assessment** — Per-traffic-type recommendations gated by subscription tier
- **Screen profile coverage** — Zone screen assignments and recommended minimums
- **Rule hygiene** — Shadowed, redundant, overly broad, disabled, and undocumented rules

Each policy is returned unchanged but annotated with severity-tagged findings (`[CRITICAL]`, `[HIGH]`, `[MEDIUM]`, `[LOW]`, `[INFO]`) in the translation notes. Click any rule to review its findings in the right panel.

### 2. Select Hardware Models

After parsing, a modal prompts you to select the source model and target SRX model. The tool auto-detects the likely source model from interface names (PAN-OS, SRX, FortiGate, Cisco, Check Point, SonicWall, or Huawei). For FortiGate sources, all current F/G-series and legacy E-series models are available. For Cisco sources, all Firepower 1000/2100/3100/4100/4200 series, virtual appliances, and EOS ASA 5500-X models are available. For Check Point, SonicWall, and Huawei USG, full model ranges are available with throughput specs. You can also select the SRX subscription (Base/A1/A2/P1/P2). Skip this or change it later via the **Models** button.

### 3. Map Interfaces

The interface mapper shows every source interface found in the config alongside the available SRX ports on the target model. The tool auto-maps `ethernet{slot}/{port}` to `ge-0/{slot-1}/{port-1}.0` by default. Adjust as needed and click **Done**.

### 4. Review & Edit Rules

The center panel shows all security rules in a sortable, filterable table. Use the **from/to** toggle above the tabs to switch between source and target views. Click any rule to see its full details in the right panel, where every field is editable. Use the tabs to also edit Zones, Objects/Address Book, and NAT rules.

### 5. Translate with LLM (Optional)

Configure an LLM provider in **Settings** (gear icon). Click **Translate with LLM** above the policy table to send all source policies to the LLM for translation into optimized SRX-compatible policies. The LLM:

- Translates actions, zones, addresses, applications, and services to SRX equivalents
- Applies vendor-specific migration knowledge (PAN-OS, FortiGate, Cisco ASA, Check Point, SonicWall, Huawei USG)
- Maps security profiles to SRX subscription tiers (Base/A1/A2/P1/P2) and flags features requiring upgrades
- Optimizes rule ordering, merges redundant rules, and adds default deny-all cleanup rules
- Sets logging best practices (log-end for permit, log-start for deny)

During translation, the right panel shows a live progress indicator with elapsed time, chunk progress, and token estimates. In **Greenfield** mode, this button is labeled **Import LLM Config**.

### 6. Review & Accept Translated Rules

After translation, all rules appear in the "to SRX" table with **LLM Reviewed** status (blue). Click any rule to see its full details and translation notes in the right panel. Review each rule and click **Accept** to mark it as accepted. A progress counter in the navbar tracks accepted vs LLM-reviewed rules.

### 7. Convert

Click **Convert to SRX** to generate the output. Switch between **Set Commands** and **XML** formats in the bottom panel. The **Warnings** tab shows any conversion notes. Use **Push via MCP** to deploy directly to SRX devices.

## Features

### SRX Health Check
- **Compliance audit** — LLM-powered assessment of existing SRX configs against PCI DSS v4.0, NIST SP 800-41r1, and CIS Juniper OS Benchmark
- **12 audit categories** — Policy hygiene, logging completeness, security profiles, screen coverage, application modernization, naming conventions, NAT best practices, zone architecture, and system infrastructure
- **Severity-tagged findings** — Each policy annotated with `[CRITICAL]`, `[HIGH]`, `[MEDIUM]`, `[LOW]`, or `[INFO]` findings in translation notes
- **Subscription-aware** — Security profile recommendations gated by the deployed SRX subscription tier (Base/A1/A2/P1/P2)
- **Non-destructive** — Policies are returned unchanged; all recommendations are advisory in `_translation_notes`
- **Simplified workflow** — No hardware migration, no interface mapping. Select source model and license, run the audit

### Save/Load Projects
- **Save project** — Export the entire project state (parsed config, interface mappings, model selections, review status, warnings, LLM-translated policies) to a `.fpic.json` file via the floppy-disk icon in the navbar
- **Load project** — Import a previously saved project via the folder icon in the navbar. A confirmation modal shows project details (name, date, vendor, model, policy count) before replacing current state
- **Auto-generated naming** — Project names are auto-generated from vendor, model, and date (e.g., `PAN-OS-PA-5260-2026-02-26`) with an editable text field before download
- **Version-safe** — Project files include a version field for forward-compatible migrations. Missing state fields are filled with defaults on load
- **Full state preservation** — Saves all workflow progress including greenfield mode, health check mode, sanitization state, and warning resolutions

### Greenfield Configuration Builder
- **Template picker** — Choose from 4 pre-built deployment templates (Branch Office, Data Center, Campus Edge, Cloud Gateway) or start blank. Templates pre-fill zones, policies, NAT, screens, routes, and system config
- **Day-0 system config** — Templates include hostname, DNS servers, NTP servers, timezone, login banner, and management services (SSH/HTTPS/NETCONF). System config is emitted in both SRX set commands (`set system host-name`, `set system name-server`, etc.) and XML output (`<system>` block)
- **LLM-guided interview** — Build an SRX configuration from scratch through a structured conversation with an AI assistant. Template-aware: skips use-case discovery when a template is loaded
- **Progressive config building** — Zones, addresses, policies, NAT, routes, screens, and system config are added to the intermediate config in real-time as the LLM collects answers
- **JSON action blocks** — LLM responses include structured action blocks (`add_zone`, `add_policy`, `add_address`, `add_nat`, `add_route`, `add_screen`, `set_system`, etc.) that auto-apply to the configuration
- **Inline action cards** — Each applied action renders as a visual card in the chat with the action type, name, and description
- **Use-case-aware** — The interview adapts to your deployment scenario (branch office, data center, campus edge, cloud gateway) with tailored zone layouts and policy recommendations
- **Real-time preview** — Toggle to the "to SRX" tab at any time to see all normal editors (Security Policies, Zones, Objects, NAT) populated with the configuration built so far
- **Seamless review** — After the interview, click **Review** to have the LLM analyze the complete built configuration for best practices and security posture

### Multi-Vendor Source Import
- **PAN-OS XML parser** — Extracts security policies, NAT rules, zones, address objects, address groups, service objects, service groups, and security profile groups from PAN-OS XML configs
- **Junos SRX parser** — Parses SRX `set` commands and hierarchical curly-brace format into the same intermediate schema (zones, address-book objects, address sets, security policies, NAT rule-sets, applications)
- **FortiGate / FortiOS parser** — Parses FortiOS `config`/`edit`/`set`/`next`/`end` block format including firewall policies, address objects, address groups, service objects, service groups, zones, VIPs (destination NAT), IP pools, central SNAT maps, and security profiles (AV, web filter, IPS, application control, SSL inspection, DNS filter, DLP, email filter)
- **Cisco ASA / FTD parser** — Parses Cisco ASA/FTD configuration including interfaces (nameif, security-level, IP), object network/service definitions, object-group network/service/protocol groups, extended access-lists with remarks, access-group bindings, and object NAT (dynamic/static). Zones are derived from interface nameif + security-level
- **Check Point R80+/R81+ parser** — Parses Check Point SmartConsole JSON export (`mgmt_cli show-access-rulebase`) including objects-dictionary with UID resolution, nested access-sections and inline layers, host/network/range/FQDN/group objects, service-tcp/udp/icmp objects, service groups, NAT rulebase (hide/static), and optional Gaia clish text for interfaces and static routes
- **SonicWall SonicOS parser** — Parses SonicWall REST API JSON export (preferred) or CLI text fallback. Handles zones with security-type mapping, IPv4/IPv6 address objects (host/network/range/FQDN/MAC), address groups, service objects, service groups, access rules with priority ordering, NAT policies (source/destination/combined), interfaces, and route policies
- **Huawei USG parser** — Parses Huawei VRP CLI (`display current-configuration`) including firewall zones with priority, `ip address-set` objects (type object and type group), `ip service-set` definitions, `security-policy` rules with zone-pair routing, `nat-policy` and `nat server` rules, `time-range` schedules, basic IKE/IPsec VPN detection, `hrp` HA configuration, and static routes
- **Auto-detection** — Automatically identifies the source format (PAN-OS XML, Junos SRX, FortiOS, Cisco ASA, Check Point JSON, SonicWall JSON/CLI, or Huawei VRP) and routes to the correct parser
- **SRX output** — Generates Juniper SRX `set` commands or hierarchical XML, including zones, address books, application mappings, security policies, NAT rule-sets, schedulers, UTM profiles (anti-virus, web-filtering, content-filtering), IDP policies, and L2 bridge-domain/family-bridge config. FortiGate Application Control generates AppFW rule-set; FortiGate DLP notes ICAP integration requirement
- **Implicit rules** — Automatically generates vendor-specific implicit rules (PAN-OS intra-zone allow + interzone deny, FortiGate intrazone per-zone + default deny, Cisco ASA security-level permits for unbound interfaces + default deny, SRX default deny). Implicit rules are visually distinguished in the UI (dimmed, italic, with "Implicit" chip) and tagged `added_by_fpic`
- **FQDN support** — Parses FQDN/dns-name address objects from all vendors and converts to SRX `dns-name`. Cisco ASA `fqdn v4`/`v6` maps to SRX `ipv4-only`/`ipv6-only`. FortiGate wildcard-fqdn (`*.example.com`) generates a warning since SRX does not support wildcard dns-name
- **L2 / transparent / virtual-wire** — Detects and converts L2 mode configurations from all vendors: PAN-OS virtual-wire pairs and L2 zones, FortiGate transparent opmode with virtual-switch and forward-domain grouping, Cisco ASA `firewall transparent` with bridge-groups and BVI interfaces, SRX bridge-domains with family bridge (round-trip). Generates SRX `set bridge-domains` and `set interfaces ... family bridge` commands. Virtual-wire pairs are mapped to bridge-domains with manual interface assignment TODOs since SRX has no native virtual-wire equivalent
- **ICMP details** — Preserves ICMP type/code through the full pipeline (parser → intermediate → converter). Generates SRX `icmp-type`/`icmp-code` instead of `destination-port` for ICMP services
- **Schedule support** — Parses schedules from all vendors (FortiGate recurring/onetime, PAN-OS schedule objects, Cisco ASA time-ranges, SRX schedulers) and converts to SRX `set schedulers scheduler` commands with `scheduler-name` references on policies
- **Nested object groups** — Correctly resolves nested address groups and service groups, emitting `address-set` (not `address`) and `application-set` (not `application`) references for group members that are themselves groups
- **Vendor-native security profiles** — FortiGate profiles (Application Control, Email Filter, DLP, DNS Filter) use FortiGate-native field names in the intermediate schema and display with correct FortiGate terminology. SRX view shows correct Junos terms (Anti-virus instead of WildFire, Anti-spam, AppSecure, DNS Security). PAN-OS profiles are mapped to SRX subscriptions: Antivirus→Flow-based AV, Anti-Spyware→Anti-malware, Vulnerability→IPS, URL Filtering→Content Security, File Blocking→Content Filtering, WildFire→noted as ATP Cloud (no direct equivalent). LLM translation sets `_srx_*` boolean flags for UI toggles with safety-net mapping from PAN-OS keys
- **Predefined Junos app detection** — Services matching Junos predefined applications (junos-ssh, junos-http, junos-https, junos-dns-udp, etc.) are automatically detected and referenced instead of generating redundant custom definitions
- **Application mapping** — 120+ cross-vendor application mappings (PAN-OS, FortiGate, Cisco ASA) to Junos predefined applications. Unmapped applications receive a `Customfwic` placeholder suffix with a warning to create a custom application definition on the SRX
- **Application groups** — PAN-OS `<application-group>` entries are parsed with their members and expanded during conversion. The Applications tab shows groups with expandable member lists, and the SRX view displays per-app Junos mapping (e.g., `junos-ssh`) or `custom:app:'name'` for unmapped apps
- **Sanitization** — One-click replacement of sensitive data (IPs, hostnames, keys) with placeholders before sharing or sending to an LLM. Originals are restored on export
- **Sanitization mapping table** — Clickable sanitize badge expands a collapsible table showing all replacements: type-colored badges (Hash, Key, SNMP, User, Public IP), masked originals for secrets (full values for public IPs), placeholder codes, and restore-on-export indicator. Inline stats summary

### Post-Conversion Diff View
- **Diff tab** — New "Diff" tab in the bottom panel (alongside SRX Output and Warnings) comparing source policies vs LLM-translated policies
- **Three-pass rule matching** — Matches rules by `_rule_index`, exact name, then fuzzy name similarity (Levenshtein with 50% threshold). Unmatched source rules shown as removed, unmatched translated rules as added
- **Field-level comparison** — For each modified rule, shows a table of changed fields (action, zones, addresses, applications, services, logging, description) with source value (red) and translated value (green)
- **Color-coded status** — Added (green), Removed (red), Modified (amber), Unchanged (dimmed). Status icons, badges, and expandable detail rows
- **Filter bar** — Filter by All, Modified, Added, Removed, or Unchanged with counts
- **LLM translation notes** — Displayed inline when rules have `_translation_notes` from the LLM

### Dual Platform View
- **"from" / "to" toggle** — Switch between source view ("from PAN-OS", "from SRX", "from FortiGate", "from Cisco ASA", "from Check Point", "from SonicWall", or "from Huawei") and target view ("to SRX") above the tab bar
- **SRX-style table** — When source is SRX (or viewing the "to SRX" tab), policies display in a zone-grouped table with SRX terminology (permit/deny/reject, security-zone, address-book)
- **PAN-OS-style table** — When source is PAN-OS, the "from" tab shows the familiar PAN-OS table layout with allow/deny actions
- **FortiGate-style table** — When source is FortiGate, the "from" tab shows a FortiOS-style policy table with FortiGate terminology (ACCEPT/DENY, From/To interfaces, Schedule, NAT toggle, security profile icons for AV/WF/IPS/App/SSL/DNS/EM/DLP)
- **Cisco ASDM-style table** — When source is Cisco ASA/FTD, the "from" tab shows a Cisco ASDM-style access control table with ACE numbering, Permit/Deny actions, ACL name badges, security level indicators, protocol chips, interface labels, log status, and hit counts
- **Check Point SmartConsole-style table** — When source is Check Point, the "from" tab shows a SmartConsole-style table with section grouping, Accept/Drop actions, Track type, and Install On targets
- **SonicWall-style table** — When source is SonicWall, the "from" tab shows a zone-pair table with priority ordering, DPI status column, and Allow/Deny actions
- **Huawei USG-style table** — When source is Huawei, the "from" tab shows a zone-pair named-rule table with Permit/Deny actions and security profile indicators
- **Negate support** — Source/destination address negation flags (PAN-OS `negate-source`/`negate-destination`, SRX `except`) displayed and editable in both views
- **Profile group expansion** — PAN-OS profile group references are automatically resolved into individual security profiles

### Interactive Editing
- **Tabbed center panel** — Switch between Security Policies/Rules, Security Zones, Address Book/Objects (with Addresses, Groups, Services, Applications, Security Profiles, and Schedules sub-tabs), NAT, Routing, and VPN editors
- **Inline table editing** — Double-click any cell in the policy table to edit directly
- **Right panel rule details** — Full editable form for the selected rule: action, zones, addresses, applications, services, logging, security profiles, tags, description
- **Schedule editor** — View, edit, add, and delete schedules from the Objects > Schedules tab. Each schedule shows its type (recurring/onetime), days, time range, and which rules reference it
- **Routing editor** — View, edit, add, and delete static routes from the Routing tab. Displays routing contexts (vsys/VDOM/routing-instance) and routes with destination, next-hop, type, interface, metric, and VRF
- **VPN editor** — View, edit, add, and delete VPN/IPsec tunnels from the VPN tab. Card-based editor showing IKE gateway (peer address, local interface, IKE version), IKE proposal (encryption, authentication, DH group, lifetime, auth method), IPsec proposal (protocol, encryption, authentication, PFS group, lifetime), tunnel interface, and traffic selectors/proxy IDs
- **Add / delete rules** — Create new rules or remove existing ones from the UI

### Hardware Awareness
- **Model selector** — Pick source firewall model (PAN-OS, SRX, FortiGate, Cisco, Check Point, SonicWall, or Huawei USG, including EOS/legacy models) and target SRX model from a built-in hardware database with port counts and throughput specs. Throughput numbers are best-effort from publicly available data
- **Auto-detection** — Heuristics detect the likely source model from interface naming in the config (PAN-OS `ethernet`, SRX `ge-`/`xe-`/`et-`, FortiGate `port`/`wan`/`internal`/`dmz`, Cisco `GigabitEthernet`/`Ethernet1/`/`TenGigabitEthernet`, Check Point `eth`, SonicWall `X`, Huawei `GigabitEthernet`/`XGigabitEthernet` formats)
- **FortiGate models** — Full F-series (40F through 4400F), G-series (70G through 900G), and EOS E-series (30E through 500E) with port counts and throughput specs
- **Cisco models** — Firepower 1000 series (FPR-1010 through FPR-1150), 2100 series (FPR-2110 through FPR-2140), 3100 series (FPR-3105 through FPR-3140), 4100 series (FPR-4112 through FPR-4145), 4200 series (FPR-4215 through FPR-4245), virtual (ASAv, FTDv), and EOS ASA 5500-X series (ASA-5506-X through ASA-5555-X)

### LLM Translation & Review Workflow
- **Translate with LLM** — One-click translation of all source policies to optimized SRX format using vendor-aware, subscription-aware LLM prompts. The translation prompt includes vendor-specific migration pitfalls and cross-vendor gap analysis for all 6 supported source vendors
- **Translation progress** — Real-time progress panel in the right pane showing elapsed time (live ticking timer), chunk progress, and estimated prompt/response token counts
- **Review status tracking** — Every translated rule starts as *LLM Reviewed* and must be manually accepted. Status labels are color-coded: blue for LLM Reviewed, green for Accepted, grey for Disabled
- **Status filtering** — Filter the policy table by review status (All / Unreviewed / LLM Reviewed / Accepted / Disabled) — available on the "to SRX" tab
- **Accept rules** — Click any rule to review its details and translation notes, then click Accept. A progress counter in the navbar tracks accepted vs LLM-reviewed policies (`Policies: X/Y accepted`)
- **Warning review workflow** — Clickable warnings badge in the navbar shows unresolved/total count and switches to the Warnings tab on click. Each warning has Ack/Fixed/Ignore action buttons to track resolution. Resolved warnings are dimmed and filterable (All/Unresolved/Resolved). Badge turns green when all warnings are addressed
- **Subscription-aware translation** — SRX subscription tier (Base/A1/A2/P1/P2) is passed to the LLM, which maps security profiles to the correct tier and flags features requiring upgrades in `_translation_notes`
- **SSL Decryption → SSL Proxy mapping** — PAN-OS decryption rules (separate rulebase) are sent as context to the LLM during translation. The LLM sets `_srx_decrypt: true` on security rules whose traffic matches decrypt-action decryption rules. A zone-pair safety net auto-applies the flag on any allow rules the LLM missed

### LLM Integration
- **Multiple providers** — Claude (Anthropic), OpenAI, Ollama, LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Browser-only API keys** — All credentials stay in `localStorage` and never touch the server
- **Editable system prompts** — Separate prompts for ruleset translation (per-vendor) and greenfield interview. Prompts are stored as plain-text files in `static/prompts/` (editable on disk) with Settings UI overrides and hardcoded fallback defaults. Each has its own sub-tab in Settings with independent Reset to Default
- **Per-vendor translation prompts** — 7 vendor-specific translate prompts (PAN-OS, FortiGate, Cisco ASA, Check Point, SonicWall, Huawei USG, SRX-to-SRX) each containing that vendor's full feature equivalency matrix, specific migration pitfalls, action mapping, and security profile translation rules. Auto-selected at translation time based on detected source vendor. Editable per-vendor in Settings via dropdown selector
- **Subscription-aware translation** — SRX subscription tier is included in both the system prompt and user prompt, ensuring security profiles are correctly mapped to available features
- **Real-time progress** — Translation progress panel shows live elapsed time, chunk progress, and token estimates during LLM calls

### Conversion Features
- **Security policies** — Zone-based firewall rules with source/dest addresses, applications, services, actions, logging
- **NAT** — Source NAT, destination NAT, static NAT with zone-pair rule sets
- **Address & service objects** — Named objects, groups, FQDN addresses

- **Security profiles** — UTM policy generation from source AV, web filter, file blocking profiles using source-derived parameters (block categories, file extensions, scan settings); IDP policies with severity-specific actions mapped from source vulnerability/spyware profiles (reset-both → drop-connection, alert → no-action); SecIntel from EDL/threat feeds
- **L2 / bridge domains** — Bridge domain definitions, L2 interfaces with family bridge, VLAN IDs, IRB routing interfaces. Virtual-wire pairs mapped to bridge-domains
- **Rule optimization** — Shadow detection (fully shadowed rules), reorder recommendations (deny after broader permit), redundant rule detection (subset of earlier permit), mergeable rule suggestions (adjacent rules differing in one dimension), consolidation opportunities (3+ rules combinable with address groups)
- **Static routes** — Virtual router routes, VRF/routing-instance support, blackhole routes
- **VPN / IPsec** — IKE proposals/policies/gateways, IPsec proposals/policies/VPNs, traffic selectors, proxy IDs

MNHA generates `set chassis high-availability` commands with ICL, liveness detection, and services redundancy groups. SRX4700 targets automatically require MNHA. Only 2-node MNHA is supported at this time
- **Screens / DDoS** — Zone protection profiles, DoS policies, threat detection → SRX screen ids-option
- **Syslog** — Syslog server forwarding, facility/severity mapping, TCP/TLS transport
- **DHCP** — DHCP server pools, relay helpers, address assignment

### Push & Integration
- **Push via MCP** — Connect to an MCP server to push configurations directly to SRX devices (configurable in Settings)
- **Push to SDC** — Security Director Cloud integration (coming soon)
- **Push to Mist** — Juniper Mist Cloud integration (coming soon)
- **Convert confirmation** — Warning dialog when converting with unaccepted policies
- **Feedback / suggestions** — Chat-bubble icon in the navbar opens a feedback modal where users can submit bug reports, feature requests, or improvement ideas as pre-filled GitHub Issues

### Not Supported (Manual Migration Required)

The following features are **not converted** by this tool and must be configured manually on the target SRX:

- **AAA / Authentication** — RADIUS, TACACS+, LDAP server configuration and authentication policies
- **Dynamic Routing Protocols** — BGP, OSPF, EVPN, VxLAN (only static routes are converted; planned for Rev8)
- **User-ID / Identity Policies** — PAN-OS User-ID, FortiGate FSSO, Cisco IDFW user/group-based policies (planned for Rev8)
- **SSL/TLS Decryption** — PAN-OS decryption rules are parsed, displayed in the SSL B&I tab, and used during LLM translation to set `_srx_decrypt` on matching security rules. However, full SRX SSL Proxy config generation (certificate management, PKI, proxy profiles) is not yet automated
- **Policy-Based Forwarding** — PAN-OS PBF rules are parsed and displayed in the PBF tab but not converted to SRX filter-based forwarding
- **NetFlow / Telemetry** — sFlow, traffic monitoring, streaming telemetry
- **Management Access** — Admin users, SNMP communities, SSH/API access restrictions

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the full roadmap and planned features.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/parse` | Parse config text (PAN-OS XML, Junos SRX, FortiOS, Cisco ASA, Check Point JSON, SonicWall JSON/CLI, or Huawei VRP) into vendor-neutral intermediate JSON. Auto-detects source format. |
| `POST` | `/api/convert` | Convert intermediate JSON to SRX output (set commands or XML) |
| `POST` | `/api/sanitize` | Replace sensitive data in config text with placeholders |

## Configuration

### LLM Settings

All LLM configuration is stored in `localStorage` under the key `llm-settings`. No API keys are ever sent to the server. Supported providers:

| Provider | Key Required | Default URL |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Claude (Anthropic) | Yes | `api.anthropic.com` |
| OpenAI | Yes | `api.openai.com` |
| Ollama | No | `localhost:11434` |
| LM Studio | No | `localhost:1234` |
| Custom | Optional | User-specified |

### LLM System Prompts

Editable plain-text prompt files control how the LLM behaves during translation and greenfield interviews. Edit these files directly on disk — changes take effect on page reload:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `static/prompts/translate.txt` | **Default translate** — Generic SRX translation rules, subscription tiers, security profile mapping (fallback when no vendor-specific prompt exists) |
| `static/prompts/translate-{vendor}.txt` | **Per-vendor translate** — Full feature equivalency matrix, vendor-specific pitfalls, action mapping, profile translation for each source vendor (panos, fortigate, cisco_asa, checkpoint, sonicwall, huawei_usg, srx) |
| `static/prompts/full-review.txt` | **Translate LLM instructions** — Cross-vendor migration pitfalls summary, SRX best practices, translation priorities |
| `static/prompts/greenfield.txt` | **Greenfield interview** — guided SRX config builder with use-case discovery, progressive config building via JSON action blocks, best-practice recommendations |
| `static/prompts/translate-srx_healthcheck.txt` | **SRX Health Check** — audit prompt with 12 assessment categories (PCI DSS v4.0, NIST SP 800-41r1, CIS Benchmark, logging, profiles, screens, hygiene, apps, naming, NAT, zones, system) |

**Priority order:** For translation, vendor-specific prompts take precedence: user edits in Settings UI (per-vendor localStorage) > vendor-specific file (`translate-{vendor}.txt`) > generic user edits > generic file (`translate.txt`) > hardcoded defaults. Select a vendor in the Settings prompt dropdown to view or edit its prompt. Click "Reset to Default" to revert to the on-disk version.

### MCP Settings

MCP server configuration is stored in `localStorage` under the key `mcp-settings`. Use the Settings modal (MCP Connection tab) to configure the server URL, test the connection, and view connected SRX devices.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server listen port |
| `NODE_ENV` | — | Set to `production` to serve static build instead of Vite HMR |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, JSX (no TypeScript, no bundled CSS framework)
- **Backend**: Express 4, fast-xml-parser
- **Build**: Vite 5 with `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with dark theme (CSS variables, no preprocessor)
- **LLM**: Direct browser-to-provider API calls (no server proxy)
